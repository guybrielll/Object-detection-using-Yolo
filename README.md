# Object-detection-using-Yolo
Object Detection using YOLO (You Only Look Once) is an advanced computer vision technique that enables the rapid and accurate identification of objects within images and videos. Unlike traditional object detection algorithms that require multiple passes over an image, YOLO is a single-shot detection system, making it incredibly fast and efficient.
